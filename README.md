# Titanic Disaster Prediction Model

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning models.  
It uses the famous Titanic dataset containing information such as **age, gender, passenger class, fare**, and more.

## About the Project
The goal of this project is to build and compare different classification models to predict passenger survival.  
It demonstrates key steps in a data science workflow:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training and evaluation

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## Files in This Repository
- `classifier.ipynb` — Main notebook containing the full analysis and model training  
- `train.csv` — Training dataset  
- `test.csv` — Test dataset  
- `requirements.txt` — List of required Python libraries  

---

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Each model’s accuracy and other evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) were compared to identify the best-performing one.
