# Titanic_Prediction_Disaster_Model
The Titanic Disaster Prediction Model is a machine learning project that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic tragedy using data like age, gender, and class. Built in Python with libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn, it compares different models to find the most accurate one for predicting survival.
